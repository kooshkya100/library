My Library project:
A simple book inventory app that can store the title, author, page-count, and read status of a book. The user can add, delete and toggle the read statuses of books. All books are displayed in a grid list. The app has two layouts: day and night mode.
The book list element responds to the size of the screen, dividing into one, two, or three columns depending on the width of the viewport.
The app saves books and day/night mode preference locally and imports the data on load.
* Use the command $clear() in the command prompt to reset the app and its storage
* Use the command $addTempBooks() in the command prompt to fill the list with some books.
